# How to Push the changes
1) Get the list of changed files.
   - Find the list of changed files using command - `git status`
   - If there are conflicts, you may need to consider resolving them before proceeding to next step 

2) Add files under Git control
    - Once the conflicts are resolved (if any), changed files can be added to stage using command `git add <file_to_be_added_with_path>`

3) Commit the changes
    - After files are added under Git control, changed files can be committed in local Git repository using command `git commit -m "commit_message"`

4) Push the changes
   - Once added files are committed, changes can be pushed to remote using command `git push origin <branch_name>`
